# Product matching

Using ML/DL techniques, match similar products from the Flipkart dataset with the Amazon dataset. Once
similar products are matched, display the retail price from FK and AMZ side by side. Please explore as
many techniques as possible before choosing the final technique.
You may either display the final result in single table format OR You may create a simple form where we
input the product name and the output of prices of the product from both websites are displayed.
For example:
FDT Women's Leggings from Flipkart should be matched with FDT WOMEN'S Leggings Pants from
Amazon
